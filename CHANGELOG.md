## [1.0.8] - 2025-11-29

### Changed

- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed unused code and streamlined transport layer
  - Removed unused `craftApiRequestWithAccept` function (52 lines)
  - Simplified `craftApiRequest` to only what's needed for loadOptions
  - Removed `.DS_Store` and other OS artifacts
  - Removed `AGENTS.md` from git tracking (still in .gitignore)
  - Total source: 2041 lines across 25 files

## [1.0.7] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Block Update Partial Updates**: Added "Don't Change" option for textStyle and listStyle
  - Users can now explicitly set blocks to `body` or `none` without issues
  - Default is now "Don't Change" to support true partial updates
  - Only non-empty values are sent to API (matches task state pattern)

### Changed

- Updated `API_VALUE_REFERENCE.md` to document partial update patterns

## [1.0.6] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Block Update**: Fixed textStyle options to match valid API values
  - Removed invalid: `code`, `subtitle`, `title`
  - Added missing: `caption`, `card`, `h4`, `page`
- **Heading Detection**: `####` markdown now correctly maps to `h4` (was incorrectly mapped to `h3`)

### Added

- `API_VALUE_REFERENCE.md` - Complete reference of valid API values to prevent future issues

## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Block insert now works with code blocks (triple backticks)
- Root cause: `textStyle: 'code'` was being sent but is NOT a valid API value
- Valid textStyle values are: `card`, `page`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `caption`, `body`
- The API auto-detects code blocks from the ``` markdown syntax
- Updated `blockBuilder.ts` to not set textStyle for code blocks

## [1.0.4] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Credential test now uses `/tasks?scope=active` instead of `/blocks?date=today`
- The previous test failed with 404 when no daily note exists for today's date, incorrectly reporting "Couldn't connect"
- The new test endpoint always returns 200 OK even with empty results

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Task Update operation now supports true partial updates - State field defaults to "Don't Change" to prevent accidentally resetting completed/cancelled tasks back to "To Do"
- Verified all API endpoints match official Craft Daily Notes API documentation

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Minor code quality improvements for n8n community standards compliance
