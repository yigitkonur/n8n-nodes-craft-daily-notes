# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.11] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: API REQUIRES `textStyle` on all text blocks - cannot be omitted!
  - Previous versions omitted `textStyle` for non-headers → validation failure
  - Now ALL blocks get explicit `textStyle: 'body'` (headers get h1/h2/h3/h4)
  - Code blocks also get `textStyle: 'body'` - API auto-detects code from ``` syntax
  - Renamed `createPlainTextBlock()` → `createBodyTextBlock()` for clarity

## [1.0.10] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **Fail-Safe Error Handling**: Block builder now never throws - always produces valid output
  - If code block extraction fails → send whole content as plain text
  - If paragraph splitting fails → send whole segment as plain text
  - If any segment processing fails → send that segment as plain text
  - Ultimate fallback: any error → send entire markdown as single plain text block
  - Plain text blocks have no `textStyle` - API uses sensible defaults

### Changed

- `detectTextStyle()` now returns `undefined` for non-headers (let API decide)
- Added `createPlainTextBlock()` helper for consistent fail-safe blocks

## [1.0.9] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Code blocks with internal blank lines no longer cause 400 validation errors
  - Root cause: `splitByParagraphs()` was splitting code blocks on `\n\n`, creating invalid fragments
  - Fix: Extract code blocks BEFORE paragraph splitting using regex `/```[\s\S]*?```/g`
  - Code blocks are now preserved as single units and sent without textStyle (API auto-detects)
  - This fixes issues with markdown like:
    ```
    ```other
    line 1
    
    line 2
    ```
    ```

## [1.0.8] - 2025-11-29

### Changed

- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed unused code and streamlined transport layer
  - Removed unused `craftApiRequestWithAccept` function (52 lines)
  - Simplified `craftApiRequest` to only what's needed for loadOptions
  - Removed `.DS_Store` and other OS artifacts
  - Removed `AGENTS.md` from git tracking (still in .gitignore)
  - Total source: 2041 lines across 25 files

## [1.0.7] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Block Update Partial Updates**: Added "Don't Change" option for textStyle and listStyle
  - Users can now explicitly set blocks to `body` or `none` without issues
  - Default is now "Don't Change" to support true partial updates
  - Only non-empty values are sent to API (matches task state pattern)

### Changed

- Updated `API_VALUE_REFERENCE.md` to document partial update patterns

## [1.0.6] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Block Update**: Fixed textStyle options to match valid API values
  - Removed invalid: `code`, `subtitle`, `title`
  - Added missing: `caption`, `card`, `h4`, `page`
- **Heading Detection**: `####` markdown now correctly maps to `h4` (was incorrectly mapped to `h3`)

### Added

- `API_VALUE_REFERENCE.md` - Complete reference of valid API values to prevent future issues

## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Block insert now works with code blocks (triple backticks)
- Root cause: `textStyle: 'code'` was being sent but is NOT a valid API value
- Valid textStyle values are: `card`, `page`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `caption`, `body`
- The API auto-detects code blocks from the ``` markdown syntax
- Updated `blockBuilder.ts` to not set textStyle for code blocks

## [1.0.4] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Credential test now uses `/tasks?scope=active` instead of `/blocks?date=today`
- The previous test failed with 404 when no daily note exists for today's date, incorrectly reporting "Couldn't connect"
- The new test endpoint always returns 200 OK even with empty results

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Task Update operation now supports true partial updates - State field defaults to "Don't Change" to prevent accidentally resetting completed/cancelled tasks back to "To Do"
- Verified all API endpoints match official Craft Daily Notes API documentation

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Minor code quality improvements for n8n community standards compliance
- Alphabetized field ordering in Task Add operation per n8n linting rules
- Added conditional display for Location Date field (only shown when Location Type is Daily Note)

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Initial compliance improvements

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **Block Resource**: Get, Insert, Update, Delete, Move, Search in Document operations
- **Task Resource**: Get, Add, Update, Delete operations  
- **Collection Resource**: List, Get Schema, Get Items, Add Items, Update Items, Delete Items operations
- **Search Resource**: Search Across Daily Notes with relevance ranking
- **Smart Block Builder**: Automatically splits large markdown content into optimal blocks using preSend hooks
- **Dynamic Collection Dropdown**: Searchable dropdown for collection selection via loadOptions
- **Relative Date Support**: Use `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, or ISO format throughout
- **AI Tool Support**: Node can be used as an AI agent tool (`usableAsTool: true`)

### Technical

- Fully declarative node architecture with preSend hooks for complex operations
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Full n8n community node standards compliance
- MIT licensed for n8n Cloud compatibility
