## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Block insert now works with code blocks (triple backticks)
- Root cause: `textStyle: 'code'` was being sent but is NOT a valid API value
- Valid textStyle values are: `card`, `page`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `caption`, `body`
- The API auto-detects code blocks from the ``` markdown syntax
- Updated `blockBuilder.ts` to not set textStyle for code blocks

## [1.0.4] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Credential test now uses `/tasks?scope=active` instead of `/blocks?date=today`
- The previous test failed with 404 when no daily note exists for today's date, incorrectly reporting "Couldn't connect"
- The new test endpoint always returns 200 OK even with empty results

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Task Update operation now supports true partial updates - State field defaults to "Don't Change" to prevent accidentally resetting completed/cancelled tasks back to "To Do"
- Verified all API endpoints match official Craft Daily Notes API documentation

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Minor code quality improvements for n8n community standards compliance
